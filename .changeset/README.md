# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the packages you want to include in the changeset
3. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

This will create a new changeset file in this directory. Commit this file along with your changes.

When changes are merged to `main`, the release workflow will:

1. Collect all changesets
2. Create a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions and updates CHANGELOGs
3. When that PR is merged, publish to NPM and create a GitHub Release
