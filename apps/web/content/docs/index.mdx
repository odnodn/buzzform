# Introduction

**BuzzForm** is a modern, schema-driven form library designed specifically for React applications using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Define your forms as data, and let BuzzForm handle the rendering, validation, and state management - all with minimal boilerplate.

## Why BuzzForm?

Building forms in React can be repetitive and error-prone. You often find yourself:

- Writing the same input patterns over and over
- Manually wiring up validation logic
- Managing complex conditional field visibility
- Handling array fields and nested data structures

BuzzForm solves these problems by letting you **declare your form structure once** and automatically generating:

- **Fully typed form components** with TypeScript inference
- **Zod validation schemas** from your field definitions
- **Accessible, styled UI** using shadcn/ui components
- **Smart defaults** that work out of the box

## A Quick Look

Here's what building a form with BuzzForm looks like:

<IntroDemo />

That's it. No manual `register` calls, no separate validation schema, no repetitive JSX. Just declare your fields and go.

## How It Works

1. **Define your fields** as an array of field objects, each with a `type`, `name`, and optional configuration
2. **BuzzForm infers the schema** and generates a Zod validator automatically
3. **Render with `<FormFields />`** which maps your field definitions to shadcn/ui components
4. **Handle submission** with full TypeScript inference on your data

## Who Is This For?

BuzzForm is ideal for:

- **Developers using shadcn/ui** who want a consistent form experience
- **Teams building admin panels** or internal tools with many forms
- **Projects requiring complex forms** with conditional logic, arrays, and nested data
- **Anyone tired of form boilerplate** who wants to move faster
